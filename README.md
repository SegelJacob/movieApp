mini project: Movie application using third party API to display movie titles, ratings, overviews, images etc with search function

This project uses API integration to create a rudementary movie application with a search function. The landing page uses an API query to display top 
movies from IMDB. Movies can be scrolled through by using buttons on the left and right.Each movie tile displays it's corresponding poster as well as
IMDB score. The color of the score varies based on the level of the rating. Hovering over each tile presents an overview of the movie. 
The app is powered by JavaScript and designed using CSS.
